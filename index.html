<p>I collected feedback from my mother. Upon her seeing my inital website she told me that it look uneven and incomplete(it was). Portions of my site were not centered and were jaring to look at. Using this feedback I was able to fine tune my website and finish it.</p>
<p>Over the course of this semester and the final project I learned so much about web design. I entered this course having no background in the field whatsoever. I had absolutely not idea what I was doing and knew nothing about the creation of a website. Over the course of these past couple months I feel like I've been able to grow so much not only as a person, but as a web designer. I was able to go from not knowing what html was to creating the html and css for a website that I am proud to present to my peers.</p>
<p>In general I loved this course. I feel like I was able to learn more than I ever did in highschool within the span of these past few months. I feel like I was able to develop a great understanding of html and a good understating of css. I was able to achive the creation of a website with the understanding I have developed with html and css. I do however feel as if my comprehension of JavaScript is lacking. I do not feel like I was able to fully grasp the capabilities and how to use js fully within the few sessions it was used in.</p>
<p>That being said, I look forward to continuing my learning experience in the web design and development field and I am so incredibly proud to have Professor Wallace teach me more about the field. I happy to say that the learning techniques I have aquired over this course have made me very excited to forever learn about Web Design and Development for the forseeable future. Thank you for being and amazing Professor.</p>
